this allows you to be certain that the changes take effect at the same
point in the transaction streams on all of the nodes.  That may not be
so important if you can take something of an outage to do schema
changes, but if you want to do upgrades that take place while
transactions are still winding their way through your systems, this is
necessary.  </P

In <SPAN

properly parsed into individual SQL statements, and each statement is
submitted separately, which is a preferable handling of this.  </P

<SPAN

You should almost certainly <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>not</I
></SPAN
> use
<TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>EXECUTE SCRIPT</TT
> to add them; that leads to some
replication set locking and unlocking tables, and possibly failing to
apply the event due to some locks outstanding on objects and having to
retry a few times before it gets the change in.  If you instead apply
the index <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"directly"</SPAN
> such as with
<SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>psql</SPAN
>, you can determine the time at which
the table lock is introduced.  Adding an index to a table will require
an exclusive lock for the time it takes to build the index; that will
implicitly stop replication, while the index builds, but shouldn't
cause any particular problems.  If you add an index on a table that
takes 20 minutes to build, replication will block for 20 minutes, but
should catch up quickly enough once the index is
created.</P
