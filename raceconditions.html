the <A

describes it thus: <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"A race condition or race hazard is a flaw in
a system or process whereby the output of the process is unexpectedly
and critically dependent on the sequence or timing of other
events. "</SPAN
> In computing applications, race conditions arise most
frequently in distributed or threaded applications when multiple parts
of the application depend on some piece of shared state, and, if this
state is not properly managed, confusion (error!) arises. More
particularly, this usually involves situations where the state can
change between the time it was checked and the time of use of the
state. </P

origin node (which their state would cause them to consider a mere
provider, and therefore <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"

replicable data) before recognizing the role change from subscriber to
provider. </P
><P
> This was fixed by introducing a new <TT

allowed subscribers to be aware of their need to wait for the
