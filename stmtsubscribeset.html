><UL
><LI
><P
> Initiates replication for a replication set </P
><P
> Causes a node (subscriber) to start replicating a set of
    tables either from the origin or from another provider node, which
    must itself already be be an active, forwarding subscriber.</P
><P
> The application tables contained in the set must already
     exist and should ideally be empty. The current version of
     <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>Slony-I</SPAN
> will <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>not</I
></SPAN
>
     attempt to copy the schema of the set. The replication daemon will
     start copying the current content of the set from the given
     provider and then try to catch up with any update activity that
     happened during that copy process. After successful subscription,
     the tables are guarded on the subscriber, using triggers, against
     accidental updates by the application.
    </P
><P
> If the tables on the subscriber are
    <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"

CLASS="EMPHASIS"

></SPAN

CLASS="COMMAND"

    may wind up doing more work than should be strictly
    necessary:</P

><LI
><P
> It attempts to <TT

>TRUNCATE</TT
> the
      table, which will be efficient. </P
></LI

      prevent TRUNCATE from working), it uses

     of cascading nodes, you will need to wait for each subscriber to
     complete subscribing before submitting requests for subscriptions
     that use that node as a provider.  If you don't, it won't be a

HREF="stmtfailover.html"

    the origin</I
></SPAN

    one such <SPAN

> has forwarding turned
    off, it is possible for that node to be forcibly lost in a case of
    failover.  The problem comes if that node gets ahead of other
    nodes.</P
><P
> Let's suppose that the origin, node 1 is at SYNC number
    88901, a non-forwarding node, node 2 has processed up to SYNC
    88897, and other forwarding nodes, 3, 4, and 5, have only
    processed data up to SYNC 88895.  At that moment, the disk system
    on the origin node catches fire.  Node 2 has the
    <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>data</I
></SPAN
> up to SYNC 88897, but there is no
    remaining node that contains, in <A

HREF="table.sl-log-2.html"
>sl_log_2</A
>, the data
    for SYNCs 88896 and 88897, so there is no way to bring nodes 3-5
    up to that point.</P
><P
> At that point, there are only two choices: To drop node 2,
    because there is no way to continue managing it, or to drop all
    nodes <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>but</I
></SPAN
> 2, because there is no way to bring
    them up to SYNC 88897.</P

    directly subscribing to the origin have forwarding turned
    on. </P
