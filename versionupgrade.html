> A number of people have found
<SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"

between major <SPAN

(<SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
> e.g.</I
></SPAN

<SPAN

without requiring a substantial downtime.</P
><P
> The <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"simple"</SPAN
> way that one might imagine doing such
an upgrade would involve running <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>pg_dump</SPAN
> on
the database running the older version, and then submit the results
into a <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>psql</SPAN
> session connected to a database
instance running the newer version.  Unfortunately, the time consumed
from start to end, for this approach, may be prohibitive.  For a
database containing 40GB of data with numerous indices, the process
required involves:

<P
></P
></P><UL
><LI
><P
> Stop all applications that might modify the data</P
></LI
><LI
><P
> Start the <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>pg_dump</SPAN

></LI
><LI
><P
> Wait 40 hours for the dump/load to complete</P
></LI
><LI
><P
> Point <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"write"</SPAN
> applications to the new database</P
></LI
></UL
><P></P
><P
> And note that this approach led to a 40 hour outage.</P
><P
> <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>Slony-I</SPAN
> offers an opportunity to replace that long outage with
one as little as a few seconds long.  The approach required is to
create a <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>Slony-I</SPAN
> replica in the new version.  It is possible that it
may take considerably longer than 40h to create that replica, however,
establishing that replica requires no outage, and once it's there, it
can be kept very nearly up to date.</P
><P
> When it comes time to switch over to the new database, the
portion of the procedure that requires an application
<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"outage"</SPAN
> is a lot less time consuming:

<P
></P
></P><UL
><LI
><P
> Stop all applications that might modify the data</P
></LI
><LI
><P
> Lock the set against client application updates using
<A

></P
></LI
><LI
><P
> Submit the Slonik command <A
HREF="stmtmoveset.html"

> to shift the origin from the old database to
the new one</P
></LI
><LI
><P
> Point the applications to the new database</P
></LI
></UL
><P></P
><P
> This procedure should only need to take a very short time,
likely based more on how much time is required to reconfigure your
applications than anything else.  If you can automate all of these
steps, the outage may conceivably be a second or less.  If manual
handling is necessary, then it is likely to take somewhere between a
few seconds and a few minutes.</P
><P
> Note that after the origin has been shifted, updates are
replicated back into the <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>old</I
></SPAN
> database.  If you
discover that due to some unforeseen, untested condition, your
application is somehow unhappy connecting to the new database, you may
readily use <A
HREF="stmtmoveset.html"
>SLONIK MOVE SET</A
> again to reverse the process
to shift the origin back to the old database.</P
><P
> If you consider it particularly vital to be able to shift back
to the old database in its state at the time of the changeover, so as
to be able to outright roll back the whole change, and would like as
well the ability to shift back to the old version (with any updates
since the changeover), the following steps would accomplish that:

<P

     <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>tail -f /var/log/slony/slony1/node2/log | grep -i copy
     </TT
>
     The slony logging is pretty verbose and doing it this way will let
     you know how the copying is going. At some point it will say "copy
     completed sucessfully in xxx seconds" when you do get this it is
     done!
    </P
><P
>Once this is done it will start trying to catch up with all
     data that has come in since the replication was started. You can
     easily view the progress of this in the database. Go to the master
     database, in the replication schema there is a view called
     sl_status. It is pretty self explanatory. The field of most interest
     is the "st_lag_num_events" this declare how many slony events behind
     the node is. 0 is best. but it all depends how active your db is.
     The field next to it st_lag_time is an estimation how much in time
     it is lagging behind. Take this with a grain of salt. The actual
     events is a more accurate messure of lag.</P
