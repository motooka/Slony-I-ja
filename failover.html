that, it is almost certain that at the moment the current origin of a
set fails, the final transactions committed at the origin will have
not yet propagated to the subscribers.  Systems are particularly
likely to fail under heavy load; that is one of the corollaries of
Murphy's Law.  Therefore the principal goal is to
<SPAN

way to do that is frequent maintenance.</P

> Opening the case of a running server is not exactly what we
should consider a <SPAN

that have the lowest tolerance for terms like <SPAN
