<SPAN

<SPAN

> <A
HREF="stmtsetaddtable.html"
>SLONIK SET ADD TABLE</A
> or <A
HREF="stmtsetaddsequence.html"
>SLONIK SET ADD SEQUENCE</A
> in
order to add tables and sequences to a replication set that is
presently replicating; you must instead create a new replication set.
Once it is identically subscribed (e.g. - the set of providers and
subscribers is <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>entirely identical</I
></SPAN
> to that for the
set it is to merge with), the sets may be merged together using <A
HREF="stmtmergeset.html"
>SLONIK MERGE
     SET</A
>.</P
><P
>Up to and including 1.0.2, there was a potential problem where
if <A
HREF="stmtmergeset.html"
>SLONIK MERGE
     SET</A
> is issued while other
subscription-related events are pending, it is possible for things to
get pretty confused on the nodes where other things were pending.
This problem was resolved in 1.0.5.  Up until 1.2.1, there was still a
problem where <A
HREF="stmtmergeset.html"
>SLONIK MERGE
     SET</A
> could be requested before
all the subscriptions were complete, which would <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"muss things
up"</SPAN
> on nodes where subscription activity was still under
way. </P
><P
> Note that if you add nodes, you will need to add both <A
HREF="stmtstorepath.html"
>SLONIK STORE
     PATH</A
> statements to indicate how nodes communicate
with one another, and <A
HREF="stmtstorelisten.html"
>SLONIK STORE LISTEN</A
> statements to
configuration the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"communications network"</SPAN
> that results
from that.  See <A
HREF="listenpaths.html"
>Section 9</A
> for more details on the
latter.</P
><P
>It is suggested that you be very deliberate when adding such
things.  For instance, submitting multiple subscription requests for a
particular set in one <A
HREF="slonik.html"
><SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>slonik</SPAN
></A
> script often turns out
quite badly.  If it is <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>truly</I
></SPAN
> necessary to
automate this, you'll probably want to
submit <A
HREF="stmtwaitevent.html"
>SLONIK WAIT FOR EVENT</A
> requests in between subscription
requests in order that the <A
HREF="slonik.html"
><SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>slonik</SPAN
></A
> script wait for one
subscription to complete processing before requesting the next
one.</P
><P
>But in general, it is likely to be easier to cope with complex
node reconfigurations by making sure that one change has been
successfully processed before going on to the next.  It's way easier
to fix one thing that has broken than to piece things together after
the interaction of five things that have all broken.</P

></H2
><P
> The <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>Slony-I</SPAN
> notion of a <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>SYNC</TT
> is actually
always an <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>incremental</I
></SPAN
> thing; a
<TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>SYNC</TT
> represents the set of updates that were
committed during the scope of a particular <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>SYNC</TT
>
event on the origin node.  If a set of updates that altered the entire
contents of a table were committed in a single
<TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>SYNC</TT
>, that would affect the entire contents of the
table.  But as far as <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>Slony-I</SPAN
> is concerned, this change is
<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"incremental"</SPAN
> even though the increment happened to be
<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"the whole table."</SPAN
> </P
><P
> The only time that <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>Slony-I</SPAN
> <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"synchronizes"</SPAN
> the
contents of a table is at the time the subscription is set up, at
which time it uses <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>COPY</TT
> to draw in the entire
contents from the provider node.</P
><P
> Since subscriber tables are protected against modification by
anything other than <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>Slony-I</SPAN
>, there should be no way (aside from
horrible bugs) for tables to fall out of synchronization.  If they do,
there is some rather serious problem with <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>Slony-I</SPAN
>. </P
><P
> If some such severe corruption takes place, the answer is to
drop the table from replication, then create a new replication set and
add it back. </P
