> If the table is a heavily updated one, it is worth observing
that this alteration will require acquiring an exclusive lock on the
table.  It will not hold this lock for terribly long; dropping the

to mark the column as being dropped; it <SPAN

values in that column will continue to have that value; new tuples
will leave it NULL, and queries will ignore the column.  Space for
those columns will get reclaimed as tuples get updated.  </P

replicated.  If a failure takes place, replication is not, at this
point, providing protection on this table.  This is unfortunate but
unavoidable. </P

new sequence, and then declare it to be a primary key.  </P

a second, and, with luck, be unnoticeable to a running
