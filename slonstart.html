>The programs that actually perform <SPAN

<SPAN

><P
>You need to run one <A
HREF="slon.html"
><SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>slon</SPAN
></A
> instance for each node
in a <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>Slony-I</SPAN
> cluster, whether you consider that node a
<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"master"</SPAN
> or a <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"slave"</SPAN
>. On <SPAN
CLASS="TRADEMARK"
>Windows</SPAN
>&#8482; when
running as a service things are slightly different. One slon service
is installed, and a seperate configuration file registered for each
node to be serviced by that machine. The main service then manages the
individual slons itself. Since a <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>MOVE SET</TT
> or
<TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>FAILOVER</TT
> can switch the roles of nodes, slon needs
to be able to function for both providers and subscribers.  It is not
essential that these daemons run on any particular host, but there are
some principles worth considering:

<P
></P
></P><UL
><LI
><P
> Each <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>slon</SPAN
> needs to be able
to communicate quickly with the database whose <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"node
controller"</SPAN
> it is.  Therefore, if a <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>Slony-I</SPAN
> cluster runs
across some form of Wide Area Network, each slon process should run on
or nearby the databases each is controlling.  If you break this rule,
no particular disaster should ensue, but the added latency introduced
to monitoring events on the slon's <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"own node"</SPAN
> will cause
it to replicate in a <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>somewhat</I
></SPAN
> less timely
manner.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
> The very fastest results would be achieved by having
each <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>slon</SPAN
> run on the database server that
it is servicing.  If it runs somewhere within a fast local network,
performance will not be noticeably degraded.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
> It is an attractive idea to run many of the
<SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>slon</SPAN
> processes for a cluster on one
machine, as this makes it easy to monitor them both in terms of log
files and process tables from one location.  This also eliminates the
need to login to several hosts in order to look at log files or to
restart <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>slon</SPAN
> instances.</P

possible.  Any problems with that connection can kill the connection
whilst leaving <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"

that (typically) will not die off for around two hours.  This prevents
starting up another slon, as described in the <A

> Historically, <SPAN

been fairly fragile, dying if they encounter just about any
significant error.  This behaviour mandated running some form of
<SPAN

<SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"

another. </P

CLASS="QUOTE"

available in the <SPAN

<P
></P
></P><UL
><LI
><P
> <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>tools/altperl/slon_watchdog</TT
> -
an <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"early"</SPAN
> version that basically wraps a loop around the
invocation of <A
HREF="slon.html"
><SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>slon</SPAN
></A
>, restarting any time it falls
over</P
></LI
><LI
><P
> <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>tools/altperl/slon_watchdog2</TT
>
- a somewhat more intelligent version that periodically polls the
database, checking to see if a <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>SYNC</TT
> has taken place
recently.  We have had VPN connections that occasionally fall over
without signalling the application, so that the <A
HREF="slon.html"
><SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>slon</SPAN
></A
>
stops working, but doesn't actually die; this polling addresses that
issue.</P
></LI
></UL
><P></P
><P
>The <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>slon_watchdog2</TT
> script is probably
<SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>usually</I
></SPAN
> the preferable thing to run.  It was at
one point not preferable to run it whilst subscribing a very large
replication set where it is expected to take many hours to do the
<TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>COPY SET</TT
> (the main event that processes a
<TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>SUBSCRIBE SET</TT
> request).  The problem that came up
in that case was that it figured that since it hasn't done a
<TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>SYNC</TT
> in 2 hours, something was broken requiring
restarting slon, thereby restarting the <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>COPY SET</TT
>
event.  More recently, the script has been changed to detect
<TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>COPY SET</TT
> in progress.</P
><P
>In <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>Slony-I</SPAN
> version 1.2, the structure of the
<SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>slon</SPAN
> has been revised fairly substantially
to make it much less fragile.  The main process should only die off if
you expressly signal it asking it to be killed. </P
><P
> A new approach is available in the <A
HREF="adminscripts.html#LAUNCHCLUSTERS"
>Section 21.4</A
> script which uses
<SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>slon</SPAN
> configuration files and which may be
invoked as part of your system startup process.</P
