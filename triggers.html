interacts with this.  Let us outline those times that are interesting:</P
><P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
> Before replication is set up,
<SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>every</I
></SPAN
> database starts out in
<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"origin"</SPAN
> status, and, by default, all triggers are of the
<TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ENABLE TRIGGER</TT
> form, so they all run, as is normal
in a system uninvolved in replication. </P
></LI
><LI
><P
> When a <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>Slony-I</SPAN
> subscription is set up, on the origin
node, both the <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>logtrigger</CODE
> and
<CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>denyaccess</CODE
> triggers are added, the former being
enabled, and running, the latter being disabled, so it does not
run. </P
><P
> From a locking perspective, each <A
HREF="stmtsetaddtable.html"
>SLONIK SET ADD TABLE</A
> request will need to briefly take out an
exclusive lock on each table as it attaches these triggers, which is
much the same as has always been the case with <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>Slony-I</SPAN
>. </P
></LI
><LI
><P
> On the subscriber, the subscription process will add
the same triggers, but with the polarities <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"reversed"</SPAN
>, to
protect data from accidental corruption on subscribers.  </P
><P
> From a locking perspective, again, there is not much difference
from earlier <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>Slony-I</SPAN
> behaviour, as the subscription process, due to
running <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>TRUNCATE</TT
>, copying data, and altering table
schemas, requires <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>extensive</I
></SPAN
> exclusive table
locks, and the changes in trigger behaviour do not change those
requirements.  </P
><P
> However, note that the ability to enable and disable triggers
in a <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
>-supported fashion means that we have had no need to
<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"corrupt"</SPAN
> the system catalog, so we have the considerable
advantage that <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>pg_dump</SPAN

a completely consistent backup against any node in a <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>Slony-I</SPAN

cluster.</P
></LI

><P
> If you take a <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>pg_dump</SPAN

<SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>Slony-I</SPAN

removes <SPAN

way: rather than altering each replicated table to <SPAN

CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>Slony-I</SPAN

<TT

<CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"

<CODE

><P
> This may be expected to allow DDL changes to become
<SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>enormously</I
></SPAN

needing to take out exclusive locks on <SPAN

replicated tables (as used to be mandated by the action of dropping
and adding back the <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>Slony-I</SPAN

are locked are those ones that the DDL script was specifically acting
on.  </P
></LI
><LI
><P
> At the time of invoking <A
HREF="stmtmoveset.html"
>SLONIK MOVE SET</A

against the former origin, <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>Slony-I</SPAN

subscriber, which requires dropping the <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"

triggers, disabling the <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>logtrigger</CODE
> triggers, and
enabling the <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>denyaccess</CODE

> At about the same time, when processing <A
HREF="stmtmoveset.html"
>SLONIK MOVE SET</A
> against the new origin, <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>Slony-I</SPAN
> must transform
that node into an origin, which requires disabling the formerly active
<CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>denyaccess</CODE
> triggers, and enabling the
<CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>logtrigger</CODE
> triggers. </P
><P
> From a locking perspective, this will not behave differently
from older versions of <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>Slony-I</SPAN

triggers requires taking out exclusive locks on all replicated
tables. </P

><P
> Similarly to <A
HREF="stmtmoveset.html"
>SLONIK MOVE SET</A
>, <A
HREF="stmtfailover.html"
>SLONIK FAILOVER</A
> transforms a subscriber node into an origin,
which requires disabling the formerly active
<CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>denyaccess</CODE
> triggers, and enabling the
<CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>logtrigger</CODE
> triggers.  The locking implications
are again, much the same, requiring an exclusive lock on each such
table.  </P
