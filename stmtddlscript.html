> Executes a script containing arbitrary SQL statements on
     all nodes that are subscribed to a set at a common controlled
     point within the replication transaction stream.</P
><P
> The specified event origin must be the origin of the set.
    The script file must not contain any <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>START</TT
> or
    <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>COMMIT TRANSACTION</TT
> calls.  (This changes
    somewhat in <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> 8.0 once nested transactions, aka
    savepoints, are supported) In addition, non-deterministic DML
    statements (like updating a field with
    <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>CURRENT_TIMESTAMP</CODE
>) must be avoided, since the
    data changes done by the script are explicitly not
    replicated. </P

><H2
> Locking Behaviour </H2
><P
> Up until the 2.0 branch, each replicated table received an
    exclusive lock, on the origin node, in order to remove the
    replication triggers; after the DDL script completes, those locks
    will be cleared. </P
><P
> After the DDL script has run on the origin node, it will
    then run on subscriber nodes, where replicated tables will be
    similarly altered to remove replication triggers, therefore
    requiring that exclusive locks be taken out on each node, in
    turn. </P
><P
> As of the 2.0 branch, <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>Slony-I</SPAN
> uses a GUC that controls
    trigger behaviour, which allows deactivating the <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>Slony-I</SPAN
>-created
    triggers during this operation <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>without</I
></SPAN
> the
    need to take out exclusive locks on all tables.  Now, the only
    tables requiring exclusive locks are those tables that are
    actually altered as a part of the DDL script. </P

><H2
> Version Information </H2
><P
> This command was introduced in <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>Slony-I</SPAN
> 1.0. </P
><P
> Before <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>Slony-I</SPAN
> version 1.2, the entire DDL script was
    submitted as one <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>PQexec()</CODE
> request, with the
    implication that the <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>entire</I
></SPAN
> script was parsed
    based on the state of the database before invokation of the
    script.  This means statements later in the script cannot depend
    on DDL changes made by earlier statements in the same script.
    Thus, you cannot add a column to a table and add constraints to
    that column later in the same request. </P
><P
> In <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>Slony-I</SPAN
> version 1.2, the DDL script is split into
    statements, and each statement is submitted separately.  As a
    result, it is fine for later statements to refer to objects or
    attributes created or modified in earlier statements.
    Furthermore, in version 1.2, the <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>slonik</TT
> output
    includes a listing of each statement as it is processed, on the
    set origin node.  Similarly, the statements processed are listed
    in slon logs on the other nodes.</P
><P
> In <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>Slony-I</SPAN
> version 1.0, this would only lock the tables in
    the specified replication set.  As of 1.1, <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>all
    replicated tables</I
></SPAN
> are locked (<SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>e.g.</I
></SPAN
>
    - triggers are removed at the start, and restored at the end).
    This deals with the risk that one might request DDL changes on
    tables in multiple replication sets.</P
><P
> In version 2.0, the default value for <TT
CLASS="ENVAR"
>EVENT
   NODE</TT
> was removed, so a node must be specified.</P
